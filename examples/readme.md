# quoFEM Examples

## Organization

Every example corresponds to exactly one workflow.

<!-- Compartmentalization of examples by workflow components -->

- Such compartmentalization will facilitate well-structured automated testing procedures.

- Because it is not the intention of the SimCenter to promote specific programs as components of a workflow, it is assumed that users will make these choices entirely on their own preferences. For this reason, it is important that such users can find concise resources that can walk them through the workflow they have decided will work best. For example, if a user has decided that the best stack for their research will utilize **FEAP** and **Dakota**, they should be able to quickly find an example which demonstrates how such a problem can be set up, without being bombarded with extraneous Python files.

- Reproducing an example should not require following directions like "First set it up like *that* problem, then change *these* combination boxes".
