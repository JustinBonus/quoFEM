Outline
-------

This example demonstrates the application of surrogate-aided Bayesian calibration to identify material and section parameters of a reinforced concrete column model using experimental cyclic loading data. The study showcases quoFEM's new **Use Approximation** feature, which employs Gaussian Process (GP) surrogates within an adaptive Bayesian framework to dramatically reduce computational costs while maintaining calibration accuracy.

**Problem Setup**: A cantilever RC column (0.4m x 0.4m x 1.6m) subjected to cyclic lateral loading is modeled using OpenSeesPy with a lumped plasticity approach. Three critical parameters are calibrated: crack factor (stiffness degradation ratio), yield moment (Mp), and peak moment capacity (Mc) using 548 experimental force-displacement measurements.

**Methodology**: The surrogate-aided approach uses the GP-AB (Gaussian Process - Aided Bayesian calibration) algorithm, which iteratively builds a GP surrogate model through adaptive design of experiments. The method strategically selects training points using both exploitation (high-probability regions) and exploration (unexplored parameter space) strategies, requiring only 2xn_Î¸ evaluations per iteration.

**Key Findings**: The surrogate-aided calibration achieves substantial computational efficiency gains compared to direct TMCMC sampling, requiring orders of magnitude fewer model evaluations (in this case, 66 vs 78,000) while reducing wall-clock time by approximately an order of magnitude (13.4 vs 95.7 minutes). Despite this dramatic acceleration, the method maintains equivalent posterior accuracy with percentage differences in parameter means below 0.5%.

**Parameter Identification Results**: All three parameters show significant uncertainty reduction (89-98%) compared to prior distributions. The calibrated crack factor of ~0.25 indicates realistic stiffness degradation, while the moment capacities reveal appropriate strength hierarchy (Mp < Mc) consistent with RC behavior under cyclic loading.

**Broader Impact**: This demonstration validates the surrogate-aided approach as a transformative tool for practical Bayesian calibration of complex structural models. The method enables rigorous uncertainty quantification for computationally intensive finite element models that would otherwise make Bayesian calibration prohibitively expensive, opening new possibilities for model validation and reliability assessment in structural engineering applications.

The structural model represents a cantilever reinforced concrete column subjected to cyclic lateral loading under constant axial force. The column exhibits nonlinear behavior including concrete cracking, plastic hinge formation, and hysteretic energy dissipation. Accurate parameter identification is essential for reliable seismic performance assessment of similar structural systems.

Model Description
-----------------

Structural Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The reinforced concrete column is modeled in OpenSeesPy using a lumped plasticity approach. The column has a geometry of 0.4m x 0.4m cross-section and a height of 1.6m, representing a cantilever configuration. It is subjected to a constant axial load of 744 kN along with cyclic lateral displacement. The modeling approach utilizes an elastic beam-column element with a plastic hinge located at the base. Moment-rotation behavior is captured using a hysteretic material model, and secondary effects such as P-Delta geometric transformation are included in the analysis.

Model Parameters to be Calibrated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following three parameters are selected for calibration based on their influence on the force-displacement response:

Experimental Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The calibration data comprises force-displacement measurements obtained from cyclic testing of the reinforced concrete column. The loading protocol involved displacement-controlled cyclic loading with progressively increasing amplitude. During the test, lateral force and top displacement were measured at each step, resulting in a total of 548 displacement steps and corresponding force measurements. The recorded response exhibits pronounced hysteretic behavior, including strength degradation, which is characteristic of reinforced concrete columns subjected to cyclic loading.

quoFEM Setup
------------

The calibration is performed using quoFEM with the following configuration:

**Step 1: UQ Tab - Bayesian Calibration Settings**: In the UQ tab, select **Bayesian Calibration** as the method and choose **UCSD-UQ** as the UQ engine. For the model type, select **Non-hierarchical**, which utilizes the TMCMC algorithm for posterior sampling. Set the sample size to 1000 and the random seed to 20 to ensure reproducibility. Specify the calibration data file by providing the path to `experimentForce.csv`. To accelerate the calibration process, enable the **Use Approximation** option, which allows surrogate-aided Bayesian calibration. The figure below illustrates the recommended UQ tab configuration.

Results
-------
Upon completion of the calibration, quoFEM generates summary statistics and visualizations to help assess the results:

1. **Summary statistics**: In the **Summary** tab of the results (**RES**) panel, key metrics such as the posterior mean and posterior standard deviation for each calibrated parameter are provided. These statistics are also shown for each component of the force response.

   .. figure:: figures/RES1.png

       :figclass: align-center

2. **Posterior samples**: The **Data Values** tab of the results (**RES**) panel displays charts for visualizing the posterior samples and a table containing the values drawn from the posterior distribution of the parameters and the corresponding model responses. Posterior samples can be exported as text files for further analysis by clicking the buttons in the **Data Values** tab. Clicking on the header rows of the chart will sort the values in ascending or descending order.

For validation purposes, the same calibration was performed without the surrogate approximation (i.e., with the **Use Approximation** option disabled). The following figures show the comparison between surrogate-aided and direct TMCMC results, demonstrating that the surrogate model effectively captures the essential behavior of the structural model while providing substantial computational savings:

Discussion
----------

The Bayesian calibration successfully identified the three key parameters of the reinforced concrete column model using the experimental cyclic loading data. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in parameter uncertainty compared to the initial prior distributions, indicating that the experimental data provides valuable information for constraining the model parameters.

*Uncertainty reduction = (1 - Posterior Std Dev / Prior Std Dev) x 100%

Key Findings
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Crack Factor Parameter**: The posterior distribution of the crack factor shows the most dramatic uncertainty reduction (98.0%), with the calibrated value converging to approximately 0.25. This suggests that the experimental data strongly constrains the ratio of cracked to uncracked section moment of inertia, indicating that the column exhibits significant stiffness degradation due to cracking under cyclic loading.

**Yield Moment (Mp)**: The calibrated yield moment of 294.3 kN-m is close to the prior mean of 300.0 kN-m, but with a substantial reduction in uncertainty (96.3%). The narrow posterior distribution (standard deviation of 4.31 kN-m) indicates high confidence in the identified yield capacity of the plastic hinge.

**Peak Moment Capacity (Mc)**: The posterior mean of 459.6 kN-m is significantly higher than the prior mean of 350.0 kN-m, suggesting that the experimental data reveals a higher moment capacity than initially expected. Despite having the largest absolute posterior standard deviation (15.1 kN-m), this parameter still shows an 89.6% reduction in uncertainty.

Comparison with Results Without Surrogate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To validate the effectiveness of the surrogate-aided calibration approach, a comparison was performed between results obtained with and without the surrogate approximation:

     - 0.249
     - 0.005
     - 0.0002
     - 0.0006
   * - **Mp** (kN-m)
     - 294.3
     - 4.31
     - 294.5
     - 4.49
     - 0.17
     - 0.18
   * - **Mc** (kN-m)
     - 459.6
     - 15.1
     - 457.4
     - 15.8
     - 2.19
     - 0.73

**Validation of Surrogate Model Performance**: The comparison demonstrates excellent agreement between the two approaches, with percentage differences in posterior means being less than 0.5% for all parameters. The small differences in standard deviations indicate that both methods provide similar uncertainty quantification. The largest absolute difference occurs in the Mc parameter (2.19 kN-m difference in mean), but this represents less than 0.5% of the parameter value, which is negligible for practical engineering applications.

Computational Efficiency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The log file analysis reveals dramatic computational efficiency gains achieved by the surrogate-aided approach:

.. list-table:: Computational Performance Comparison
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 25 25 20

   * - Metric
     - Surrogate-Aided Method
     - Direct TMCMC Method
     - Efficiency Gain
   * - **Total Runtime**
     - 13.4 minutes
     - 95.7 minutes
     - 7.1x faster
   * - **Model Evaluations**
     - 66
     - 78,000
     - 1,182x fewer

The surrogate-aided method demonstrates transformative computational efficiency by requiring only 66 strategically selected model evaluations compared to 78,000 needed for direct TMCMC sampling. This remarkable 1,182-fold reduction in computational demand is achieved through an intelligent adaptive design of experiments strategy that systematically adds 6 training points per iteration (following the 2xn_Î¸ = 2x3 pattern for the three calibration parameters). Each iteration uses both exploitation points (focused on high-posterior-probability regions) and exploration points (covering unexplored parameter space) to maximize information gain from the GP surrogate model.

The 7.1x speedup in wall-clock time represents an 86% reduction in computational time, transforming what would be a 95.7-minute direct calibration into a 13.4-minute surrogate-aided process. This efficiency gain becomes even more significant for complex finite element models where individual evaluations may require hours rather than seconds. The GP-AB algorithm achieved convergence in 10 iterations with a KL divergence metric of 0.002397, substantially below the 0.01 threshold, confirming that the accelerated approach maintains rigorous convergence criteria.

Model Performance Assessment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The calibration results indicate that the experimental data is highly informative for all three parameters, as evidenced by the substantial uncertainty reductions across all variables. The posterior parameter values are physically reasonable:

- The crack factor of 0.25 represents a realistic level of stiffness degradation for reinforced concrete under cyclic loading
- The yield and peak moment capacities (294.3 and 459.6 kN-m, respectively) show appropriate strength hierarchy with Mp < Mc
- The moment capacity values are consistent with the column's geometry (0.4m x 0.4m section) and loading conditions

The successful calibration demonstrates that the lumped plasticity model with hysteretic behavior effectively captures the essential nonlinear response characteristics observed in the experimental cyclic test. The calibrated model can now be used with increased confidence for seismic performance assessment of similar reinforced concrete column systems.
