This is a SimCenter research application. It's purpose is to provide
an application that will allow users to perform uncertainty
quantification and optimization methods utliizng existing finite
element applictions.

It will run the computations locally utilizing laptop/desktop or
remotely utilizing the HPR resoursed TACC made available through DesignSafe-ci.

Please visit the [quoFEM Research Tool webpage](https://simcenter.designsafe-ci.org/research-tools/quofem-application/)
for more resources related to this tool. Additionally, this page
provides more information on the NHERI SimCenter, including other SimCenter
applications, FAQ, and how to collaborate.
