# uqFEM

This is a SimCenter research application. It's purpose is to provide
an application that will allow users to perform uncertainty
quantification and optimization methods utliizng existing finite
element applictions.

It will run the computations locally utilizing laptop/desktop or
remotely utilizing the computational resources made at tt TACC made
available through DesignSafe-ci.

Please visit the [uqFEM Research Tool webpage](https://simcenter.designsafe-ci.org/research-tools/uqfem-application/)
for more resources related to this tool. Additionally, this page
provides more information on the NHERI SimCenter, including other SimCenter
applications, FAQ, and how to collaborate.
